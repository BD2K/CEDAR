The goal of CEDAR is to create a unified framework that researchers in all scientific disciplines can use to create consistent, 
easily searchable metadata. Ease of use is paramount. Because the ability to share data is so important, 
we want the process of metadata creation to be as painless as possible. Six key elements contribute to what we 
believe will be a successful system.
